Self-study materials about data science foundations.

## Mathematical Analysis ##

Mathematical analysis forms the foundation for many concepts in data science, such as optimization, algorithms, and understanding the behavior of functions. It involves studying limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals, which are crucial for modeling and solving real-world problems.

## Linear Algebra ##

Linear algebra is fundamental in data science for managing and manipulating large datasets. It involves the study of vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. Understanding linear algebra is essential for implementing machine learning algorithms, performing data transformations, and working with multi-dimensional data.
